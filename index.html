        <p>&nbsp;The timeline of computer development extends far past what many may think. Computers are seen today as entertainment systems that are commonly found within the American home. However, computers didn’t start out as these personal entertainment devices, but rather a calculating machine for solving complicated functions and equations. The first ‘computer’ dates back to the 1600’s with an analytical calculator called the Abacus. The development in-between then and now shows great innovation and taking a look back through the years reveals a lot about the construction of the computers we rely on today.</p>
	      <p>&nbsp;The <u><a href="abacus.jpg">Abacus</a></u> was a simple calculating device made up of a, typically, wooden frame with several rods going down. Each rod carried 5 beads. This machine dates very far back and it’s name comes from the Greek word: άβακασ, or board/table. This device was later innovated in 1642 by Blaise Pascal. This became known as the <u><a href="pascaline.jpg">Pascaline</a></u>. This was an improvement upon the original Abacus and was a mechanical calculator used to solve various arithmetic functions. This machine established the basis of the reasoning for computers - to calculate, solve, and work out certain functions and equations. Up until this point, both the Abacus and the Pascaline could only compute addition and subtraction. Needs for calculations like multiplication soon provided need for improvement, yet again, on these machines.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;The next mechanical calculator was created by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz in 1694. He made it so this calculator could process more advanced arithmetic functions - such as multiplication. This later paved the way for all future versions of the mechanical calculator. Following him is a more popular name, <u><a href="cbabbage.jpg">Charles Babbage</a></u>. Babbage set the stage for the <em>real</em> start of computers. In 1812 he proposed idea for a large steam locomotive machine called the Difference Engine. 10 years later, the first general computer was created called the Analytical Engine. This machine incorporated 50,000 components as well as a punch card operating system. These perforated cards printed as a result of calculations could store 1,000 numbers of up to 50 decimal digits long. This, by far, was a major part of the development of future computers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Time passed, and many invented computers followed in the footsteps of Charles Babbage. A certain American inventor by the name of Herman Hollerith created a computer to calculate statistics of the U.S census (utilizing the punch card system). He became the founder of the International Business Machines, or IBM.</p>
